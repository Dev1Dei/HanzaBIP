<p align="center">Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client-side applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript.
It is developed and maintained by Google and is designed to make both the development and testing of such applications easier. Angular is known for its robust set of features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a modular architecture, allowing developers to create sophisticated, maintainable, and scalable web applications. Angular applications typically involve components, services, and modules that work together to provide smooth user experiences.</p>

# What is PowerBI?

</p>

<p align="center">Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Developed by Microsoft, Power BI provides cloud-based business analytics services that enable users to visualize and share insights from their data.</p>

# How to use our web application?
<p align="center">
Our web application is relatively really basic. In the application, you can see a header, which has the menu and some buttons like:
</p>
<p align="center">
-Dashboard, which consists of a dropdown table with all the dashboards that are implemented in the web application
</p>
<p align="center">
-About Us (Not developed yet)
</p>
<p align="center">
-Analytics (Not developed yet)
</p>
<p align="center">
The next main component you can see is the sidebar, it consists of:
</p>
<p align="center">
-A menu button, which has an arrow next to it, you can use it to hide the sidebar for a fullscreen immersion of the PowerBI charts.
</p>
<p align="center">
-A dashboard dropdown list, which behaves the same as the header dashboard button.
</p>
<p align="center">
-Slideshow (In progress of development)
</p>

# How to work with the slideshow?

<h2>Step 1: Launching the slideshow</h2>

<a>In our website we have implemented a simple solution to start your report slideshow.</a>

<a>In the Sidebar, you can see a menu item called Slideshow, once selected, a dropmenu opens with a form inside it.</a>

<a>In the form, you can see an input in seconds, type in how many seconds do you want to see one singular report before switching.</a>

<a>Below the input, you can see all of the available reports that you can check and select to be added to the slideshow. </a>

<a> Once you select your reports, press the button at the bottom of the table to start the slideshow </a>

<a> Congratulations! You have successfully started the slideshow! </a>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Dev1Dei/HanzaBIP/assets/114073990/ae1829ce-6f19-4579-8d00-7afcf9ab1259" alt="Material Bread logo">

<img valign='middle' alt='orange' src='https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/FFAF02'/> - Outlines the button where if everything is selected and done correctly, the slideshow will start.

<h2>Step 2: Stopping the slideshow</h2>

<a> Once you have successfully started the slideshow, stopping it is a lot easier. </a>

<a> To stop the slides, open the sidebar menu with the arrow sticking out and select a dashboard you want to view. </a>

<a> Congratulations! You have successfully stopped the slideshow! </a>

# How to add more dashboards?

<h2>Step 1: Opening the project</h2>

<a> Open the project directory (The place where your project exists on your PC) </a>

<h2>Step 2: Navigating to the reports.json file</h2>

<a> Navigate your way to the reports.json file which is located in: src -> assets -> Reports -> reports.json </a>

<h2>Step 3: Opening the reports.json file</h2>

<a> Open the reports.json file using [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ "Notepad++") or any other text editor that is available to you </a>

<h2>Step 4: Managing the reports.json file</h2>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Dev1Dei/HanzaBIP/assets/114073990/e85fc1a2-761f-4ff8-b270-c15c8838b25a" alt="reports.json file">
</p>

<a> In the reports.json file, we see fields like <strong>id</strong>, <strong>iframe</strong> and <strong>name</strong>. When adding a new dashboard, all you have to do is copy one of the dashboards that are already implemented and change its id (Lets say the last dashboard in the list was id number 8, so the next one you're gonna implement is going to have id number 9). 

Now you might be wondering, where does the iframe link come from? Read about it in Step 5</a>

<h2>Step 5: Receiving the iframe link from the PowerBI interface</h2>

<a>In this step it is important to have an account to login to the [PowerBI](https://app.powerbi.com/home?experience=power-bi "PowerBI") workspace.  </a>

<a> Once logged in to the [PowerBI](https://app.powerbi.com/home?experience=power-bi "PowerBI") workspace, you need to locate your desired report and open it. </a>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Dev1Dei/HanzaBIP/assets/114073990/0842f333-215e-4218-bc93-679a31448de8" alt="Finding your report">
</p>

<a> In this example, you can see that I have located my own report </a>

<img valign='middle' alt='red' src='https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/FF0202'/> - Outlines where to Click/Hover once you opened your desired report.

<a> When you finished clicking on the File -> Embed Report -> Website or portal you will see a table popup, where you have an option to download either the link to the report, or the html tag. </a>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Dev1Dei/HanzaBIP/assets/114073990/f4bb2f2c-5f2e-4180-a833-7e1c90e1c13c" alt="Table popup">
</p>

<img valign='middle' alt='red' src='https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/FF0202'/> - Outlines the important iframe link you have to copy.

<a> Once you copy the link upper link, the same one that was outlined in the screenshot. You can open the reports.json again, and paste the link in to your new dashboards <strong>iframe</strong> section </a>

<h2>Step 6: Name your dashboard</h2>
<a>In this step, we are still working in the reports.json file, the last field is <strong>name</strong>, you need to name your dashboard. The name will be visible everywhere on the website application (ex. The sidebar dashboard dropbox)</a>

<h2>Step 7: Save the reports.json file</h2>

<a> After every line is filled, it is really important that you make sure you did not miss any commas or brackets {}. Keep the structure the same as the other dashboards are filled in. </a>

<a> Once you made sure everything is correct, hit CTRL+S or in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ "Notepad++") go to File and click Save. </a>

<p align="center">

</p>

<h2>Step 8: Launch the project and check your new dashboard</h2>

# Launching the project on your machine

<h2>Step 1: Geting everything for your workspace</h2>

<a> In this step we will talk about all the required installations to be done to launch your angular project </a>

<h2>
  
[Node.js (download)](https://nodejs.org/en/download "Node.js")
</h2>
<a> One of the most important things for launching your Angular application is to download Node.js, it is recommended to download the latest LTS version. </a>

<a> Once completed, launch Node.Js from your file explorer and you will see a command line open </a>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Dev1Dei/HanzaBIP/assets/114073990/3615cda1-0b37-4ad0-8412-f72f623e3fc7" alt="Node.Js command line">
</p>

<a> Once opened, make sure to type in the console  npm install -g @angular/cli and press ENTER. You will see an installation process happen. </a>

<a> Once completed, you will have most of the components ready for launching your Web Application </a> 

<h2>

[Visual Studio Code (download)](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download "Visual Studio Code")
  
</h2>

<a> Time for the most important install, you need to get an IDE to launch this project. We highly recommend using Visual Studio Code, because it brings a user friendly interface to read and use your code solutions.  </a>

<a> The installation process is as with any program you would install, so lets go to the next step </a>

<h2>Step 2: Launching the project itself </h2>

<a> Now, we're hoping that you have successfully pulled this project from github, and you have a folder in somewhere in your computer called HanzaBIP. If not, please read more about pulling the projects from github [here](https://linuxhint.com/pull-my-project-from-github/)

<a> Launch your [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download "Visual Studio Code") and you should see a screen looking like this:</a>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Dev1Dei/HanzaBIP/assets/114073990/7b7c104a-f9a2-4471-9649-30a74f2b07a3" alt="Node.Js command line">
</p>

<img valign='middle' alt='red' src='https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/FF0202'/> - Outlines where you should click once the window has opened to locate the HanzaBIP folder.

<a> Once you find your folder when clicking on the 'Open folder' option, you should be able to see this screen:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Dev1Dei/HanzaBIP/assets/114073990/4b2a7311-2322-4e89-bed4-24bbfbc93722" alt="You have successfully opened the project in Visual Studio Code">
</p>

<a> Congratulations, you have officially opened our project on [Visual Studio Code! (download)](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download "Visual Studio Code")  </a>

<a> Sadly, we are still not done. </a>

<h2>Step 2.5: Opening the terminal</h2>

<a> We are getting really close to seeing the web application working, but first you'll need to find a way to open the terminal. </a>

<a> To open the terminal, you'll need to navigate your mouse to the upper part of your screen, where you'll see a tab called 'Terminal'. Click on it and select new terminal </a>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Dev1Dei/HanzaBIP/assets/114073990/4f7b0588-b959-4789-a0f7-146a6c2c8a10" alt="You have successfully opened the project in Visual Studio Code">
</p>

<img valign='middle' alt='red' src='https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/FF0202'/> - Outlines the places where you need to click to open up a new terminal.

<img valign='middle' alt='green' src='https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/21FF02'/> - Outlines the new opened terminal.

<a> Once you see the terminal, we need to make sure you have all the packages, write in the terminal npm install and hit ENTER on your keyboard </a>

<a> You will notice theres many packages being installed and it might take a minute or two </a>

<a> When the package installations are completed, we are ready to launch the project. </a>

<a> Type in the terminal: ng serve --open </a>

<a> Wait for the project build itself and once its done, it should launch your default browser straight in to the web application </a>

<h2> Step 3: Enjoy! </h2>

<a> Congratulations! You have successfully launched the project and you can use it freely. </a>
